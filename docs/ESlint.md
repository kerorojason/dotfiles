# ESlint

A default `.eslintrc.json` is included with this dotfiles, so that we can use a globally installed `eslint` for small experimental projects with some sweet defaults.

## Setup

Before using the globally installed `eslint`, you need to install it with some config and plugin packages:

```
$ npm install -g eslint babel-eslint eslint-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-native eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-import
```
